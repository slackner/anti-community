Installation
============

As a first step, please make sure that all required dependencies are installed.
The following commands can be used to install missing packages on Ubuntu or
Debian operating systems:

$ sudo apt-get install build-essential
$ sudo apt-get install libgsl-dev

Afterwards, just extract the source code to a directory of your choice and run:

$ make

If everything goes well, the program terminates with exitcode 0. If not, the
error message should hopefully contain a hint what is going wrong. All
compiled programs will be located within the src/ and third-party/ directory.

Self-Test
=========

After the compilation finished, it makes sense to run the included self-tests
to check that everything works fine. The tests are all located in the src/
folder, so we first have to switch to the right directory:

$ cd src

To run the self-tests of the library itself, execute:

$ make test

To run tests for the Python bindings, execute:

$ ./pygraph.py

Graph File Format
=================

Most programs contained in this package require graph data with the following
input format:

--- snip ---
NumberOfNodes
StartNode EndNode [Weight]  \
StartNode EndNode [Weight]   } Edges
StartNode EndNode [Weight]  /
[...]
--- snip ---

The first line defines the number of nodes, all following lines describe the
edges (first node index, second node index, optional weight). Lines starting
with "#" are comments and have to be ignored. An example for a trivial graph
can be seen in src/data/example-trivial.graph.

Programs
========

The current version of the package contains the following programs. Each
program also has a separate help, which can be shown by running
"PROGRAM --help", e.g., "src/laprop --help".

$ src/gml
	Convert graph to GML file format.

$ src/laprop
	Apply label propagation algorithm to the graph specified by the given file.

$ src/maxmodularity
	Agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm for community detection /
	modularity maximization.

$ src/minmodularity
	Agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm for anti- community
	detection / modularity minimization.

$ src/antimodularity
	Agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm for anti- community
	detection / anti-modularity maximization.

$ src/components
	Return connected components of an undirected graph.

$ src/modularity
	Compute modularity and anti-modularity for the graph specified by the given
	file.

$ src/subgraph
	Extract subgraph specified by the given files.

As an example, the following commandline applies a Modularity minimization
algorithm to the Adjectives and Nouns dataset.

$ src/minmodularity datasets/adjectives-noun/result.graph

By default, the output is written directly to the terminal. Nevertheless, if
preferred, it can also be redirected to a file:

$ src/minmodularity datasets/adjectives-noun/result.graph > output.txt

Datasets
========

The datasets directory contains a collection of various small graphs. The
graphs already have been converted to the correct format. Each directory
contains a file called "result.graph".

After changing the implementation of an algorithm, it is sufficient to execute:

$ cd datasets
$ make clean
$ make

to run all evaluations again. This might take a few minutes. In each directory,
a "metrics.txt" file will be created, which contains common measures (such as
the number of communities, Modularity, Antimodularity, etc.) and can be used to
compare different algorithms.
